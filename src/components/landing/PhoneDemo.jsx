/**
 * The looping chat demo, cropped tight to just the phone — no dark backdrop margin
 * around it. /chatbot-demo.html renders a 390×780 phone centered inside its own
 * 440×900 canvas (25px/60px of backdrop on each side, plus the "ONBOARDING FLOW" label
 * and corner crop-marks). Rather than showing that whole canvas shrunk to fit a small
 * box (which is what left so much empty space around a tiny phone before), this scales
 * the iframe up and translates it so ONLY the phone lands inside the box — the backdrop
 * spills past the edges and gets clipped by overflow-hidden.
 *
 * `transform: scale(S) translate(-25px, -60px)` — translate runs first (rightmost),
 * shifting the phone's own top-left corner to the canvas origin; scale then blows the
 * whole thing up together. The -25/-60 offsets are the phone's fixed position inside its
 * canvas in chatbot-demo.html and stay constant across breakpoints — only S changes,
 * driven by the box's own width so `container` stays in sync with `iframe` without a
 * media query having to update two numbers in lockstep.
 *
 * Sized up to the phone's native 390×780 (scale 1, no blur) once there's room for it,
 * and a smaller scale where there isn't — see the two rules below.
